Naming conventions
------------------

here are some naming conventions to observe during the rewrite:  
(taken from http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)

* Packages and Modules: short, all-lowercase names (use underscores for readability)  
ex: `numpy`

* Classes: CapWords (use leading underscore for internal-use Classes)  
ex: `IsotropicMaterial`, `_Material`

* Exceptions: CapWords, with the suffix "Error" (if the exception is an error)  
ex: `MessageError`

* Global Variables: lowercase, (use underscores for readability)  
ex: `spar_span_length`

* Functions: lowercase, (use underscores for readability)  
ex: `make_file`

* Methods: lowercase, (use underscores for readability)  
ex: `inspect`

* Instance variables: lowercase, (use underscores for readability)  
ex: `node_no`

* Constants: all capital letters with underscores separating words
